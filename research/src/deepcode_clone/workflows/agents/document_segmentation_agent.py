  """
  Intelligent document segmentation agent with semantic analysis capabilities.
  
  This enhanced agent provides:
  1. **Semantic Document Classification**: Content-based document type identification
  2. **Adaptive Segmentation Strategy**: Algorithm integrity and semantic cohenrece preservation
  3. **Planning Agent Optimization**: Segment preparation specifically optimized for downstream agents
  4. **Quality Intelligence Validation**: Advanced metrics for completeness and technical accuracy
  5. **Algorithm Completeness Protection**: Ensures critical algorithms and formulas remain intact
  
  Key improvements over traditional segmentation:
  - Semantic content analysis vs mechanical structure splitting
  - Dynamic character limits based on content complexity
  - Enhanced relevance scoring for planning agents
  - Algorithm and formula integrity preservation
  - Content type-aware segmentation strategies
