Document Segmentation MCP Server

This MCP Server provides intelligent document segmentation adn retrieval functions for handling
large research papers and technical documents that exceed LLM token limits.

==== CORE FUNCTIONALITY ====
1. Analyze document structure and type using semantic content analysis
2. Create intelligent segments based on content semantics, not just structure
3. Provide query-aware segment retrieval with relevance scoring
4. Support both structured (papers with headers) and unstructured documents
5. Configurable segmentation strategies based on document complexity

==== MCP TOOLS PROVIDED ====

ðŸ“„  analyze_and_segment_document(
      paper_dir: str, 
      force_refresh: bool = False
    )
    > Purpose: Analyzes document structure and creates intelligent segments
    - Detects document type (research paper, technical doc, algorithm-focused, etc.)
    - Selects optimal segmentation strategy based on content analysis
    - Creates semantic segments preserving algorithm and concept integrity
    - Stores segmentation index for efficient retrieval
    - Returns: JSON with segmentation status, strategy used, and segment count
    
    
    
ðŸ“–  read_document_segments(
      paper_dir: str,
      query_type: str,
      keywords: List[str] = None,
      max_segments: int = 3,
      max_total_chars: int = None
    )
    > Purpose: Intelligently retrieves relevant document segments based on query context
    - query_type: "concept_analysis", "algorithm_extraction", or "code_planning"
    - Uses semantic relevance scoring to rank segments
    - Applies query-specific filtering and keyword matching
    - Dynamically calculates optimal character limits based on content complexity
    - Returns: JSON with selected segments optimized for the specific query type
    
    
    
ðŸ“‹  get_document_overview(
      paper_dir: str
    )
    > Purpose: Provides high-level overview of document structure and available segments
    - Shows document type and segmentation strategy used
    - Lists all segments with titles, content types, and relevance scores
    - Displays segment statistics (character counts, keyword summaries)
    - Returns: JSON with complete document analysis metadata
    
    
    
========== SEGMENTATION STRATEGIES ==========
> semantic_research_focused : For academic papers with complex algorithmic content
> algorithm_preserve_integrity : Maintains algorithm blocks and formula chains intact
> concept_implementaion_hybrid : Merges related concepts with implementation details
> semantic_chunking_enhanced : Advanced boundary detection for long documents
> content_aware_segmentation : Adaptive chunking based on content density
=============================================


========== INTELLIGENT FEATURES ==========
> Semantic boundary detection (not just structural)
> Algorithm block identification and preservation
> Formula chain recognition and grouping
> Concept-implementation relationship mapping
> Multi-level relevance scoring (content type, importance, keyword matching)
> Backward compatibility with existing document indexes
> Configurable via mcp_agent.config.yaml (enabled/disabled, size thresholds)
==========================================
